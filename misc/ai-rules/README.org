* AI-RULES
Cookie cutter to add AI rules and files for various AI agents.

Currently tested with:
- cline
- windsurf

If you're looking for how to do AI assisted coding(this repo follows all the ideas mentioned here), check:

** Usage
This project-agnostic cookiecutter can be used in a new or existing repository.
*** Setup
First ~cd~ inside the directory where you store project level docs. Usually ~/docs~. And run run the following:
#+begin_src shell
cookiecutter --overwrite-if-exists https://github.com/alwaysbecooking/freshmold.git --directory="misc/ai-rules"

# NOTE: docs_path should be relative to repository root
cruft create \
--overwrite-if-exists \
https://github.com/alwaysbecooking/freshmold.git \
--directory="misc/ai-rules"
#+end_src
Make sure the overwites are the things that you want, if not edit the git-diff manually.
*** Management
- If you have existing files, they'll be overwritten, so better to run this version controlled so you can see the changes this cookie cutter is making.
- This will also fetch all the rules that I maintain over all my projects, you should be able to manually just pick the ones that you need and remove the rest
- Use the rules as contexts (~@mention~) when trying to enforce certain rule. Otherwise The management of the rules is specific to each AI agent, eg. Cursor follows different convention, windsurf follows a different convention, Amp is different etc. So you can adjust things accordingly. For common rules, I put things under ~.clinerules/~ directory.
- If you're using a monorepo, you'd be switching back and forth between the rules

Following are ~Justfile/Makefile~ entries based on whichever agent you're using: (Copy manually as per need)
#+begin_src makefile
cline-meta-ai-rules:
	mkdir -p .clinerules
	rg -F "^.clinerules/$" .gitignore > /dev/null || echo ".clinerules/" >> .gitignore
	cp ./docs/for_ai/rules/meta_* ./.clinerules/
#+end_src
**** AI Ignore files
AI agents would usually have a file which you can use to instruct about files it should avoid reading. Put the following in it. Eg. for cline, that ~.clineignore~
#+begin_src
# Dependencies
node_modules/
**/node_modules/
.pnp
.pnp.js

# Build outputs
/build/
/dist/
/out/

# Testing
/coverage/

# Environment variables
.env
.envrc
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Large data files
*.csv
*.xlsx
#+end_src
*** Cleanup
- If you donâ€™t need support for certain AI agents, feel free to delete their related files after generation.
*** TODO Keeping things in sync
