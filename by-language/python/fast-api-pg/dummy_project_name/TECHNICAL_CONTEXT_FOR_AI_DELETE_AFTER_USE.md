## Project Overview

This project is a FastAPI application generated from a cookiecutter template. It is designed with a modern Python stack, emphasizing best practices for development, testing, and deployment. It includes structured logging, configuration management, and a comprehensive set of development tools managed via `Justfile` and `nix`.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Dependency Management**: `uv`
- **Package Management & Build**: `hatchling` (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- **Task Runner**: `Justfile`
- **Environment Management**: `nix` for reproducible development environments.
- **Containerization**: Docker image building is managed through `nix`.

## Development Workflow & Tooling

The `Justfile` in the project root provides commands for all common development tasks.

- **Run the development server**: `just dummy_project_name-server`
- **Run tests**: `just test` (uses `pytest`)
- **Run code quality checks**: `just check` (runs `ruff` for linting, `mypy` for type checking, and `bandit` for security scanning).
- **Fix code automatically**: `just fix` (runs `ruff --fix` and `black` for formatting).

## Project Structure

- `src/dummy/`: Contains the main application source code.
  - `main.py`: The FastAPI application entry point. It initializes the app, sets up middleware (logging, security headers), and includes the API routers.
  - `config.py`: Manages application settings using `pydantic-settings`.
  - `routers/`: Contains API route modules. Example: `cash.py`.
  - `telemetry/`: Configures structured logging using `structlog`.
- `tests/`: Contains the test suite using `pytest`.
- `pyproject.toml`: Defines project dependencies, build system (`hatchling`), and tool configurations (`ruff`, `black`, `mypy`, `bandit`).
- `flake.nix` / `flake.lock`: Defines the Nix development environment for full reproducibility.
- `Justfile`: Provides a command-line interface for development tasks.

## Key Features

- **Structured Logging**: Uses `structlog` for JSON-formatted, context-rich logs.
- **Configuration Management**: Settings are managed via environment variables and Pydantic models in `config.py`.
- **Middleware**: Includes middleware for logging HTTP requests and adding security headers to responses.
- **Global Exception Handling**: A global exception handler is in place to catch unhandled errors and return a generic 500 response.
- **Health Check**: A `/healthz` endpoint is provided for monitoring application health.
- **Dockerization**: Builds multi-platform Docker images using `nix` for consistent and reproducible builds.
