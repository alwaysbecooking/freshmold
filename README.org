** Requirements
- https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io
- Most of the cookiecutters probably make use of nix, so having working knowledge of nix or willingness to lean into the intricacies of nix is assumed.
- insanity (we need more insanity)

* Others
- See the [[https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/5336
][sorry state of github templates]]
- I checked [[https://github.com/cruft/cruft][cruft]], but I think once a project takes off from a cookie-cutter/boilerplate, there's no looking back. Just keep making forward progress. There are some cases where consistency is important but the way I develop things that's not the case. So we use plain old cookiecutter.
