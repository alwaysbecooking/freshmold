* freshmold

A collection of personal, opinionated cookiecutter templates.

** Philosophy

This project uses two different tools for managing templates, each for a specific purpose:

- *cookiecutter* is used for bootstrapping new projects. Once a project is created, it is independent and does not receive updates from the original template. This is for projects where you want to "fire and forget."

- *cruft* is used for managing shared, standardized components *within* an existing project. It allows these components (like a set of AI rules) to be updated from a central template over time. The ~misc/ai-rules~ template is an example of this approach.

** Requirements

- [[https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][cookiecutter]]
- [[https://cruft.github.io/][cruft]] (for templates that support ongoing updates)
- Many templates use [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] for environment management. Familiarity with Nix is recommended.
